# Flow style - It does not use indentation or whitespace to denote nesting, as block style does. 
# This can make it difficult to read if it contains complex data structures. 
# The flow style syntax begins with a left curly brace ({), followed by the data structure elements separated by commas (,). 
# Each element must be on its own line, without any indentation. The last element must also be followed by a right curly brace (}).
